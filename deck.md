#Let's Talk BigApps

#You're here to:
- Find people to help you build an idea
- Find a team to join who has a good idea
- Decide what to build

#Stakes are high:
- Lots of participants
- Big idea partners
- Short timeline

#So Validating Is Important

- Get users quickly

#Validating Saves:
- Time
- Money
- Code
- Heartache

#No Pressure!

#How Do You Validate Quickly?
1. Know Your Users and Their Problems
2. Use A Lean Hypothesis
3. Write a Value Proposition
4. Validate Without Code
5. Build to Validate

---

#1. Know Your Users & Problems
- What problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How might you solve the problem for users?

--- 

#2. Use A Lean Hypothesis
- We believe [type of people] have a problem doing [thing]
- We think we can fix it by building [solution]
- We'll know we're right if [change in behavior]

---

#Focus Your Hypothesis
- Be specific
- Make it measurable
- Make it defensible

---

#3. Write a Value Proposition
##Answer your users' questions:
- Why am I here?
- What can this thing do for me?
- Do I belong here?

---

#Great Value Propositions:
- Remember Everything (Evernote)
- Built Better Software, Together (Github)
- Make Money for 12 Minutes of Your Time (12ish)

---

#Bad Value Propositions:
- Give us 5 minutes and we'll supercharge your website (CloudFlare)
- Cross-platform ephemeral messages (BurnNote)
- Team inbox for email & twitter (Respondly)

---

#4. Validate Without Code
- Surveys
- Coffee-shop customer development
- Splash Page
- Adwords experiments
- Events

---

#Surveys
- Use google forms
- Ask questions about past behavior
- Ask "when was the last time you did..."
- Do not ask about hypotheticals
- Pass the "Mom Test"
- Incentivize

--- 

#Coffee Shops
- Recruit on Craigslist
- Qualify that they are in your user sweet spot
- Ask questions about past behavior
- Ask them to commit to something

---

#Splash Page
- URL
- Company Name
- Value Proposition
- Email Form

---

#Post-Splash page
- Capture emails
- Send a thoughtful auto-respond
- Ask them to do something (survey, contact you, follow you, pay)

---

#AdWords 
- Track unique visitors & new email addresses
- Use Google's Keyword Tool
- Find specific, local keywords & include typos
- Write copy for 3 different ads
- Set the keywords to your splash page
- Set a budget ($100 for 4 weeks)
- Refine as needed

---

#Organize an Event
- Pick a relevant topic
- Invite relevant people to speak
- Repeat
- You're now a thought leader in your space

---

#5.Build to Validate
- A prototype is smallest thing to build to validate/invalidate your Lean Hypothesis 
- Build to validate/invalidate first
- From there, iterate to your MVP
- Gather feedback constantly
